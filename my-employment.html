        <li>Description:</li>
        <li>Pebbletree is a provider of a self developed Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) platform. VoIP provides telecommunication services over the internet replacing the need for more traditional telecommunication systems.</li>
        <li>Pebbletree’s brands  include Soho66, Quvu, Usomo, Simply66 and Goldfish. These brands provide a cutting edge communication service to their customers.</li>
        <li>As a technical support advisor my role is to assist customers with any questions or issues that they are having with the services provided by any of Pebbletree’s brands. In this role I am often the first point of contact between the customer and Pebbletree,</li>
        <li>therefore a high level of customer service is required as all contact between myself and the customer impacts on the image of the brand and the company as a whole. I am tasked with investigating customer's issues and either resolving these issues myself or,</li>
        <li>if there is an issue I am unable to resolve, escalating those issues to the departments with the required technical expertise to resolve the issue and keep the customer informed of the progress made until a resolution is found.</li>
